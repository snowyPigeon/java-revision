# java-revision
Classes written to revise Java concepts.

## What this repo contains
A Main class, a Garden class and a Blackbird class. The Garden and Blackbird classes have properties, the details of which are output to the screen when the main method is run.

## What the main method does
The main method outputs information about the Garden and Blackbird, then accepts some input from the user to test their ability to recall a tree found in the garden. Regex is used to check the user input against the array of trees held by an instance of Garden, and also against a vowel pattern. The script ends by confirming what the user chose or that the entered tree was not found.
